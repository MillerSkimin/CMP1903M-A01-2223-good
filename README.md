# CMP1903M-A01-2223-but-working
This is my project for CMP1903M-A01-2223 in which unfinished code was given to me and I had to finish it then have it reviewed by peers. Although strenuous as I am bad at C# it works :)
I'm better at python I promise :)
The code is an application for simulating a deck of cards. It defines a Card class with attributes for the card's value and suit, and a Testing class with a Test method that creates and shuffles a deck of cards. The Program class calls the Test method before the start of the program to test and display the usage of the methods and classes used when running

There were issues with updating the repo with the new file of "NewTest" and general updating of files so a new repo was required to solve the problem. The old repo does exist if that is required to view the history
